CIFAR-100 CNN Model Implementation with TensorFlow and Keras

Overview:
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras for classifying images from the CIFAR-100 dataset. The CIFAR-100 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class. The model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics are detailed below.

Dataset:
The CIFAR-100 dataset is a collection of images classified into 100 classes, each containing 600 images. The images are 32x32 pixels in size, with three color channels (RGB). The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing.

Model Architecture:
The CNN model architecture used for this project consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction, and fully connected layers for classification. The exact architecture is detailed in the source code.

Dependencies:

Python 
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
